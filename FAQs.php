	<h2 style="color: #26619c;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<h3 style="color: #26619c;">Eligibility</h3>

	<p style="color: #26619c;"><b>Are minimum grade-point averages, class ranks or test scores required for admission? </b></p>
	<p>The Office of College Admissions reviews each application on a holistic basis — a complicated name for a very simple concept. 
	The admissions committee considers a candidate’s entire application—academic and extracurricular records, essays, letters of recommendation
	and SAT or ACT scores — in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of a student’s qualifications and potential.</p><br>
	
	<p style="color: #26619c;"><b>Is it possible to transfer to AAST from another college or university? </b></p>
	<p>Yes. The University of AAST defines a transfer applicant as a student who has completed one term as a full-time student in a degree-seeking 
	program at another college or university.

	Transfer students must attend the College for at least two academic years (six quarters) and complete the Core curriculum
	and at least half of their major with us. Tentative evaluations of transfer credit are conducted by the Office of the Dean of Students
	and mailed out over the summer to enrolling students</p><br>
	
	<p style="color: #26619c;"><b>Does AAST consider applicants who have been home schooled?</b></p>
	<p>Yes. As a home-schooled applicant, you will have the same application requirements as any other candidate, 
	plus the Home School Supplement to the Secondary School Report</p><br>
	
	<p style="color: #26619c;"><b>Can students begin studies at AAST during the spring quarter?</b></p>
	<p>Yes. As a home-schooled applicant, you will have the same application requirements as any other candidate, 
	plus the Home School Supplement to the Secondary School Report</p><br>
	
	<p style="color: #26619c;"><b>Does AAST require interviews?</b></p>
	<p>Interviews are not required for admission into the College but can be a way for students to learn more about the University of AAST. 
	We offer on campus interviews as well as alumni interviews around the world, both of which are treated equally in the admission process</p><br>
	
		<p style="color: #26619c;"><b>Is financial aid available?</b></p>
	<p>Yes. Our financial aid policy is need-based, meaning we guarantee to meet all demonstrated financial need from each student’s family.
 Each financial aid package is tailored to the student and family’s particular financial profile; 
 we require a few forms in order to offer you an appropriate package. 
Although you may apply for financial aid at any time, we recommend that you apply for aid when you apply for admission in order to receive an aid decision in a timely manner.</p><br>
